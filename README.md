# slowloris
A golang slowloris implementation

This is a sample implementation for the slowloris DDoS attack.
This sample implementation exists for demonstration purposes of the accompanying paper in this repository.
The paper shows that against popular belief, with the right implementation of the attack even ngingx server can be attacked
by slowloris.

This repo is for educational purposes only. I do not encourage ussage of the slowloris implementation against any machine that is not yours or for which you have the permission to use it against. I also am not responsible for anything you do with this script.
